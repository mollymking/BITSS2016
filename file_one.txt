Hey, I'm a text file!

Today, I'm learning about version control with Git. Here are my notes:

Ready - contains information about other files

access to files is controlled - cannot make changes in another person’s repository
“forking” - is Github’s name of making a copy

clone - same as copy something that is online to your local machine
—> good practice: when clone, could name “FileName_repo” on local machine

file is either unchanged since last time GitHub took snapshot of things in repository, or file has been changed

Uncommitted - could disappear
Commitment is for life
Once commit files, Git compares local files on hard drive to files Git has in version control
usually want to add thematic types of changes, then commit all of those together
